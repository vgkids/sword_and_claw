I've heard the people I respect and admire described as _verocious readers_, so I've long aspired to become one myself.

On a purely practical level, if I read a book and get one good idea from it, the impact of that $25 purchase and a few hours of my time could be the best investment of my life.

I manually re-write the most salient clips of what I'm reading to slow down and immerse myself more deeply in the idea. If this collecting and curating can benefit others while simultaneously paying homeage to the authors, that's a 3x win.
