A _fundamental attribution error_ is using perceived personality attributes––"You're stupid, lazy, greedy hypocritical, an asshole," etc.––to explain someone else's behavior rather than considering one's own behavior and/or the situational factors that were probably the real cause of the other person's behavior. It's a problem because 1) it's generally inaccurate and 2) it renders an otherwise solvable problem really hard to fix since changing core personality atttributes is so very difficult and time consuming. ...but [it is] so much easier and more satisfying in the moment to just accuse [someone] of being greedy[lazy/stupid/hypocritical].
