My best moments revolve around creating clear, well defined goals and prioritizing them.

I see the major opportunity and risk areas, build a team to respond to them, and systems so that everyone understands what is expected of themselves and each other.

Remove ambiguity. Design processes. Delegate with clear responsibilities.
