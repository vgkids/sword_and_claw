When considering a decision, the mind gives disproportionate weight to the first information it receives. Initial impressions, estimates, or data anchor subsequent thoughts and judgements.

...Be careful to avoid anchoring your advisers, consultants, and others from whom you solicit information and counsel. Tell them as little as possible about your own ideas, estimates, and tentative decisions. If you reveal too much, your own preconceptions may simply come back to you.

-- John S. Hammond, Ralph L. Keeney, and Howard Raiffa; On Making Smart Decisions

>Revealing my thoughts sets the tone of the discussion, and the information I get is skewed as a result.
