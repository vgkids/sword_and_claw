"[The little things one can do to increase happiness] won't surpise you any more than "eat less and exercise more" does. The main things are to commit to some simple behaviors– meditating, exercising, getting enough sleep– and to practice altruism. One of the most selfish things you can do is help others. Volumnteer at homeless shelter. You may or may not help the homeless, but you will almost surely help yourself. And nurture your social connections. Twice a week, write down three things you're grateful for, and tell someone why." 

- Daniel Gilbert, as intereviewed by Gardiner Morse for the Harvard Business Review



- Commit to simple well-being goals
- Help others
