... the patients who didn't write out any plans were at a significant disadvantage, because they never thought ahead about how to deal with painful inflection points. They never deliberately designed willpower habits. Even if they intended to walk around the block, their resolve abandoned them when they confronted the agony of the first few steps.

––Charles Duhigg, The Power of Habit

>I love the idea that willpower is a skill and a muscle, and like muscles, it has to be developed and maintained. I saw this when I started running and again when I started surfing– both activities I started in my 30's. If you start using your body in a new way, it's clumsy and inept at first. But slowly, over a period of weeks and months, it physically changes to meet the new demand. If we demand more of our willpower and our mind, it too will rise to meet the challenge.
