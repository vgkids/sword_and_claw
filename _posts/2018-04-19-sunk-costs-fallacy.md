Companies do not start from scratch every day. Their history, and what they learn from it, matter. But history leads us astray when we evaluate options in reference to a past starting point instead of the future. The most visible consequence is the _sunk-cost fallacy_: When considering new investments, we should disregard past expenditures that don't affect future costs or revenues, but we don't.

[One] should look at this investment the way an incoming CEO might: If I personally hadn't decided to [make the original investment], would I invest [today]?

-- Daniel Kahneman, Dan Lovallo, and Olivier Sibony, On Making Smart Decisions

>The key is not to _blindly_ persevere, but to evaluate your current circumstances from fresh perspectives, given what you've learned. Perseverence applies to _goals_, where as _strategies_ to achieve those goals need to remain flexible. As we decide which strategies are working and which aren't, we need to be vigilant against the sunk-cost fallacy.
