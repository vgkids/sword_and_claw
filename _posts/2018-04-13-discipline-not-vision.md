The best leaders we studied did not have a visionary ability to predict the future. They observed what worked, figured out _why_ it worked, and built upon proven foundations. They were not more risk taking, more bold, more visionary, and more creative than the comparisons. They were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid.
