Psychological studies show that we quickly and easily start believing whatever comes out of our own mouths, even when the original reason for expressing the opinion is no longer relevant.

--Dan Ariely, The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty

>Have you ever been in a conversation, and as you start to speak, you realize what you're saying is true? Sometimes you can almost hear a switch flipping from "maybe this is true?" to 'Yes, this is the Truth'.
>
>I've always assumed this was from organizing one's thoughts into speech, but now I'm wondering if it's at least partially due to our innate need for consistency. Essentially, to suppress the cognitive dissonance of having said something you don't believe, we subconciously choose to believe it.

>Be careful what you sayâ€“ it could become the truth, at least for you.
