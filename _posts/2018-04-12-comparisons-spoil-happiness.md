>Wheather it's how much money someone has, their friends, their vacactions, their looks, etc., these comparisons to yourself are the root of so much misery. Online this especially easy and to worse effect, because you only see the parts of someone's life that are beautiful/noteworthy/exciting.

>Same thing is true in the startup world, where posturing is rampant and it seems everyone is "killing it" at all times.
